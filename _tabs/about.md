## About This Site

Welcome to my portfolio site!

### Purpose of This Site

This site exists to showcase my whole identity in a single place. Think of it as a gallery of all the things I’ve put my energy and time into. It’s a place where creativity meets functionality, and where ideas are brought to life.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Projects:** A collection of my finished (and sometimes pending & unfinished) projects.
- **Learning and Tricks:** Occasional posts about what I’m learning and little tricks I’ve picked up along the way. From tech tips to random hacks, it’s all here.
- **Contact:** Want to get in touch? There’s a form for that. Whether you have a question, a comment, or just want to say hi, feel free to drop a message.
